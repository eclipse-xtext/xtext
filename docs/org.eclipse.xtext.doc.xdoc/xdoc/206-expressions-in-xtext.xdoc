section:expressions[Parsing Expressions with Xtext]

Parsing simple XML-like, structural languages with Xtext is a no-brainer. However, 
parsing nested expressions is often considered complicated. This is the perception 
due to their recursive nature and the properties of the parser technology used by Xtext.
You have to avoid left recursive parser rules. As the underlying Antlr parser 
uses a top-down approach it would recurse endlessly if you had a left recursive grammar.

Let's have a look at parsing a simple arithmetic expression:

code[Java][2 + 20 * 2]

If you know EBNF a bit and wouldn't think about avoiding left recursion, operator precedence 
or associativity, you'ld probably write a grammar like this:

code[Xtext][Expression :
  Expression '+' Expression |
  Expression '*' Expression |
  INT;
]

This grammar would be left recursive because the parser reads the grammar top down and left to 
right and would endlessly call the Expression rule without consuming any characters, i.e. altering 
the underlying state of the parser. While this kind of grammar can be written for bottom-up parsers, 
you would still have to deal with operator precedence in addition. That is define that a multiplication 
has higher precedence than an addition for example.

In Xtext you define the precedence implicitly when left-factoring such a grammar. Left-factoring means 
you get rid of left recursion by applying a certain idiom, which is described in the following.

Here is a left-factored grammar (not yet working with Xtext) for the expression language above:

code[Xtext][Addition :
  Multiplication ('+' Multiplication)*;

Multiplication:
  NumberLiteral ('*' NumberLiteral)*;

NumberLiteral:
  INT;
]

As you can see the main difference is that it uses three rules instead of one, and if you look a bit closer 
you see that there's a certain delegation pattern involved. The rule Addition doesn't call itself but calls 
Multiplication instead. The operator precedence is defined by the order of delegation. The later the rule 
is called the higher is its precedence. This is at least the case for the first two rules which are of a 
left recursive nature (but we've left-factored them now). The last rule is not left recursive which is why 
you can implement it without applying this pattern.

The next task is to allow users to explicitly adjust precedence by adding parentheses,
e.g. write something like code[Java][(2 + 20) * 2].
So let's add support for that (note that the grammar is still not working with Xtext):

code[Xtext][Addition :
  Multiplication ('+' Multiplication)*;

Multiplication:
  Primary ('*' Primary)*;

Primary :
  NumberLiteral |
  '(' Addition ')';

NumberLiteral:
  INT;
]

Once again: if you have some construct that recurses on the left hand side, you need to put it into the 
delegation chain according to the operator precedence. The pattern is always the same: the thing that 
recurses delegates to the rule with the next higher precedence.

section2[Construction of an AST]

Now that left recursion is avoided, the parser should produce a proper syntax tree. In Xtext each 
rule returns a value. Production rules return AST nodes (i.e. instances of EObject), enum rules return enum 
literals and data type rules as well as terminal rules return simple values like strings.
Xtext can automatically infer whether some rule is a production rule, i.e. constructs and returns an AST node, 
or if it is a data type rule that returns a value. The grammar above only consists of data type rules all of 
them returning plain strings.
In order to construct an AST we need to add assignments and actions to the grammar.

The return type of a rule can be specified explicitly using the code[Xtext][returns] keyword but can be 
inferred if the type's name is the same as the rule's name.
That is

code[Xtext][NumberLiteral : ... ;
]

is a short form of

code[Xtext][NumberLiteral returns NumberLiteral : ... ;
]

However in the case of the expression grammar above, all rules need to return the same type since they are 
recursive. In order to make the grammar valid, a common return type has to be added explicitly 
(but the grammar is still missing some bits):

code[Xtext][Addition returns Expression:
  Multiplication ('+' Multiplication)*;
  
Multiplication returns Expression:
  Primary ('*' Primary)*;
  
Primary returns Expression:
  NumberLiteral |
  '(' Addition ')';
  
NumberLiteral:
  INT;
]

The AST type inference mechanism of Xtext will infer two types: Expression and NumberLiteral. Assignments and actions 
have to added to store all the important information in the AST and to create reasonable subtypes for the 
additive and multiplicative expressions. The fully working Xtext grammar is this:

code[Xtext][Addition returns Expression:
  Multiplication ({Addition.left=current} '+' right=Multiplication)*;
  
Multiplication returns Expression:
  Primary ({Multiplication.left=current} '*' right=Primary)*;
  
Primary returns Expression:
  NumberLiteral |
  '(' Addition ')';
  
NumberLiteral:
  value=INT;
]

This is how the parser processes the following expression:

code[Java][(1 + 20) * 2
]

It always starts with the first rule (Addition). Therein the first element is an unassigned rule call 
to Multiplication which in turn calls Primary. Primary now has two alternatives. The first one is calling 
NumberLiteral which consists only of one assignment to a feature called 'value'. The type of 'value' has to be 
compatible to the return type of the INT rule.

But as the first token in the sample expression is an opening parenthesis '(' the parser will take the second 
alternative in Primary: it consumes the '(' and calls the rule Addition. Now the value '1' is the lookahead token 
and again Addition calls Multiplication and Multiplication calls Primary. This time the parser takes the first 
alternative because '1' was consumed by the INT rule.

As soon as the parser hits an assignment it checks whether an AST node for the current rule was already created. 
Otherwise it will create one based on the return type of the current rule, which is NumberLiteral. 
The Xtext generator created the EClass 'NumberLiteral' before which can now be instantiated. That type will also have 
a property called value of type int , which will get the value '1' set. This is what the 
Java equivalent looks like:

code[Java][// value=INT
if (current == null)
 current = new NumberLiteral();
current.setValue(ruleINT());
...
]

Now that the rule has been completed the produced EObject is returned to the calling rule Primary, which in turn 
returns the object unchanged to its own caller. Within Multiplication the rule Primary has been successfully 
parsed and returned an instance of NumberLiteral. The remainder of the rule (everything within the parentheses) 
is a so called group. The asterisk behind the closing parenthesis states that this part can be consumed zero or more 
times. The first token to consume in this group is the multiplication operator '*'. Unfortunately in the current 
input the next token to accept is the plus sign '+', so the group is not consumed at all and the rule returns 
the NumberLiteral that was returned from the previous unassigned rule call.

In rule Addition there is a similar group but this time it expects the correct operator. The parser steps into the group.
The first element in the group is an assigned action. It will create a new instance of type Addition and assigns what 
was the to-be-returned object to the feature 'left'. In Java this would have been something like:

code[Java][// Multiplication rule call
current = ruleMultiplication();
// {Addition.left=current}
Addition temp = new Addition();
temp.setLeft(current);
current = temp;
...
]

As a result the rule would now return an instance of Addition which has a NumberLiteral set to its property left. 
Next up the parser consumes the '+' operator. The operator itself is not stored in the AST because there is an explicit 
Addition type. It implicitly contains this information.
The assignment code[Xtext][right=Multiplication] calls the rule Multiplication another time and assigns its result object 
(a NumberLiteral of value=20) to the property code[right].
The closing parenthesis is matched afterwards, consumed and the parser stack is reduced once more.

The parser is now in the rule Multiplication and has the multiplication operator '*' on the lookahead. It steps into 
the group and applies the action. Finally it calls the Primary rule, produces another instance of NumberLiteral (value=2), 
assigns it as the 'right' operand of the Multiplication and returns the Multiplication to the rule Addition which 
in turn returns the very same object as there's nothing left to parse.

The resulting AST looks like this:

section2[Associativity]

There is still one topic worth to mention, which is associativity. There is left and right associativity as well as non-associativity.
The example implemented left associativity. Associativity tells the parser how to construct the AST when 
there are two infix operations with the same precedence. The following example is taken from the corresponding wikipedia entry:

Consider the expression a ~ b ~ c. If the operator ~ has left associativity, this expression would be interpreted as 
(a ~ b) ~ c and evaluated left-to-right. If the operator has right associativity, the expression would be interpreted 
as a ~ (b ~ c) and evaluated right-to-left. If the operator is non-associative, the expression might be a syntax error, 
or it might have some special meaning.
The most common variant is left associativity:

code[Xtext][Addition returns Expression:
  Multiplication ({Addition.left=current} '+' right=Multiplication)*;
]
Right associativity is done using a slightly modified pattern. Note the quantity operator and the call to the rule itself in the group:

code[Xtext][Addition returns Expression:
  Multiplication ({Addition.left=current} '+' right=Addition)?;
]

Non-associativity can be implemented in a similar way, but this time the final rule call is not immediately recursive but delegates
to the next precedence level:

code[Xtext][Addition returns Expression:
  Multiplication ({Addition.left=current} '+' right=Multiplication)?;
]

Sometimes it's more convenient to allow associativity on parser level, but forbid it later using validation. This allows
more descriptive diagnostics. Also the whole parsing process won't rely on error recovery but the editor will generally 
be more forgiving.
