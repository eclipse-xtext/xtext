chapter:builddsl[Build Language]

Build tools like Ant or link[http://www.gradle.org/][Gradle] decompose the build process into a set of tasks. A task can 
stand for a compilation step, copying some files, bundling, running tests etc. The order of execution is calculated from 
the dependencies of the defined tasks.

img[images/builddsl_screenshot.png][][][]

This build language combines the declarative approach of defining tasks and dependencies with the full power of a 
modern expression language. It is a bit similar to Ant but statically typed and with very good IDE support.

section:builddsl_solution[Overview]

The above screenshot shows an exemplary build script. A script has a couple of parameters. The 
tasks define dependencies to other tasks. What happens if the task is executed is defined in a block
within curly braces.   

A build script can be run from the command line, assigning values to the parameters in the syntax
code[myscript --<paramName> <value>]. 

We have put most functionality of the language in the runtime library: Detecting the order of execution,
parsing parameters, etc. The language itself focusses on the structural parts, and leaves the actions
to Xbase. This allows both us and future users to add new tasks as library methods instead of hard-coding them 
in the language.

section:builddsl_running[Running the Example]

In the runtime workspace, open the e[BuildExample.build] in the editor. The example project comes with 
some sample java code to compile in the e[example-project] folder. Choose e[Run as > Build Task] from the context
menu of any task to execute it.  

section:builddsl_grammar[Grammar]

The grammar of the DSL is once again quite slim:
 
code[Xtext][
grammar org.xtext.builddsl.BuildDSL with org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.Xbase

generate build "http://www.xtext.org/builddsl"

BuildFile:
	("package" name=QualifiedName)?
	importSection=XImportSection?
	declarations+=Declaration*;

Declaration:
	Task | Parameter;

Parameter:
	'param' type=JvmTypeReference? name=ValidID ('=' init=XExpression)?;

Task:
	'task' name=ValidID 
	('depends' depends+=\[Task|ValidID\] (',' depends+=\[Task|ValidID\])*)?
	action=XBlockExpression;
]

A e[BuildFile] starts with a e[package] declaration. The generated Java class will be located in this
namespace. The next part is an e[importSection]. Since version 2.4, Xbase includes extensive tooling
to validate and organize import statements. To make this available in your language, you just have to include
an e[XImportSection] as in this example. The imports are followed by the e[Declarations].
A e[Declaration] can be a e[Task] or a e[Parameter]. A e[Parameter] can declare a type and an initialization
expression. e[Tasks] define dependencies on other tasks by means of an Xtext cross-reference. They also
contain an action, which is a codeRef[org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.XBlockExpression] from Xbase, thus everthing 
is possible within a task.

section:builddsl_inferrer[Translation to Java]

For each e[BuildFile] we create a Java class that extends the library class 
codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.lib.BuildScript]. We generate a main method allowing to execute the script as
a Java application with command line parameters. The use of code[Java][System.exit] allows to return error codes
to the caller.  

table[
tr[td[DSL]td[code[builddsl][
package sample
]]]

tr[td[Java]td[code[Java][
package sample;
...
public class SimpleBuild extends BuildScript {
...
  public static void main(final String... args) {
    SimpleBuild script = new SimpleBuild();
    if (script.showHelp(args)) {
      System.exit(HELP);
    }
    System.exit(script.doBuild(args));
  }
...
}]]]
]

The respective inferrer code looks like this:
code[Xtend][
class BuildDSLJvmModelInferrer extends AbstractModelInferrer {

  @Inject extension JvmTypesBuilder

  def dispatch void infer(BuildFile file, 
                          extension IJvmDeclaredTypeAcceptor acceptor, 
                          boolean isPreIndexingPhase) {
    val qualifiedName = file.javaClassName
   	val simpleName = Strings.lastToken(qualifiedName, ".")
    accept(file.toClass(fqn))\[
      superTypes += typeRef(BuildScript)
...      
      val stringArray = typeRef(String).addArrayTypeDimension
      members += file.toMethod("main", typeRef(Void.TYPE)) \[
        parameters += filetoParameter("args", stringArray)
        varArgs = true
        static = true
        body = '''
          «scriptName» script = new «scriptName»();
          if (script.showHelp(args)) {
            System.exit(HELP);
          }
          System.exit(script.doBuild(args));
        '''
      \]
    \]
...]


Each e[Task] becomes a method in the Java class. A codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.lib.DependsOn] annotation
communicates the dependencies to the runtime. The superclass will scan for such annotations and execute
the dependencies in the right order.

table[
tr[td[DSL]td[code[builddsl][
task print depends prepare {
  print(name)
}]]]
tr[td[Java]td[code[Java][
@DependsOn("prepare")
protected void print() {
  InputOutput.<String>print(this.name);
}
]]]
]

The annotation part may be interesting, so here is the snippet from the inferrer:
 
code[Xtend][
// a method for the actual task body
members += file.tasks.map\[ task | toMethod(task.methodName, typeRef(Void.TYPE)) \[
  visibility = JvmVisibility.PROTECTED
  annotations += annotationRef(DependsOn, task.depends.map\[name\])
  body = task.action
  \]
\]
]

Finally, we create a field with the codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.lib.Param] annotation from each e[Parameter]. 
The superclass will make the so marked fields initializable from command line arguments. 

table[
tr[td[DSL]td[code[builddsl][
param name = 'World'
]]]
tr[td[Java]td[code[Java][
@Param
public String name = "World";
]]]
]

The type can be skipped. If there is an initialization expression, the parameter's type is inferred from the 
initialization expression. If that one is missing, too, codeRef[java.lang.String] 
is assumed. The Elvis-operator e[?:] comes handy for this use case. The different sources are tried to find the
best type for the field. In the inferrer, this looks like:

code[Xtend][
@Inject ITypeProvider typeProvider
...
val type = declaredParameter.type 
	?: declaredParameter?.init?.inferredType
	?: typeRef(String)
]

section:builddsl_validation[Validation]

When e[Tasks] are depending on each other, cycles will break the computation of the execution order.
There is a check for this constraint in the validator codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.validation.BuildDSLValidator]:

code[Xtend][
class BuildDSLValidator extends XbaseJavaValidator {
...
  @Check
  def void checkNoRecursiveDependencies(Task task) {
    task.findDependentTasks \[ cycle |
      if (cycle.size == 1) {
        error('''The task '«task.name»' cannot depend on itself.''', 
            cycle.head, DECLARATION__NAME, CYCLIC_DEPENDENCY)
      } else {
        error('''There is a cyclic dependency that involves tasks «
                cycle.map\[name\].join(", ")»''', 
              cycle.head, DECLARATION__NAME, CYCLIC_DEPENDENCY)
      }
    \]
  }
...]  

section:builddsl_imports[Imports]

By using the e[XImportSection] form Xbase, the language automatically supports the notion of e[plain imports],
e[static imports] and e[static extension imports]. While the first two work as in Java, a static extension
import puts the static methods of the specified calls on the extension scope, such that it can be called
as if it were a method on the first argument. See the ref:xtend_extension[Xtend primer] for a more detailed
description.

We ship some predefined extension classes to enhance the Java classes codeRef[java.io.File]
and codeRef[java.lang.Class]. These are always put onto the extension scope by a customized 
codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.scoping.BuildDSLImplicitlyImportedTypes]:

code[Xtend][
class BuildDSLImplicitlyImportedTypes extends ImplicitlyImportedFeatures {
	/**
	 * Add methods from {@link FileExtensions} and {@link ClassExtensions} to the extension scope.
	 */
	override protected getExtensionClasses() {
		(super.getExtensionClasses() + #\[FileExtensions, ClassExtensions\])
			.toList
	}
}
]

As always, such an implementation has to be bound in the codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.BuildDSLRuntimeModule]:

code[Java][
public class BuildDSLRuntimeModule 
    extends org.xtext.builddsl.AbstractBuildDSLRuntimeModule {
...
  public Class<? extends ImplicitlyImportedFeatures> 
      bindImplicitlyImportedFeatures() {
    return BuildDSLImplicitlyImportedTypes.class;
  }
}
] 

section:builddsl_library[Operator Overloading]

As we expect a build language to deal with files and directories a lot, we have extended the syntax 
around these in the codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.lib.FileExtensions]. We leverage the fact that Xbase 
allows to overload operators by means of library extensions. The following examples show how to avoid 
the noisy constructor calls to codeRef[java.io.File]:

table[
tr[td[DSL]td[code[builddsl][
val dir = 'someDir'.file
val file = dir / 'fileName.txt'
val theSameFile = 'someDir' / 'fileName.txt'
]]]
tr[td[Java]td[code[Java][
final File dir = FileExtensions.file("someDir");
final File file = FileExtensions.operator_divide(dir, "fileName.txt");
final File theSameFile = FileExtensions.operator_divide(
    "someDir", 
    "fileName.txt");
]]]
]

The compiler replaces operators with method calls to methods named code[Xtend][operator_<operatorName>()].
These have to be callable on the left operand, i.e. be a method of the left operands type or be added
as an extension to the left operand type. In this case, we use the latter approach, since codeRef[java.io.File]
as well as codeRef[java.lang.String] are sealed types. To learn more about operators and operator overloading
please consult the link[http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation.html#Xbase_Expressions_Operators][Xtext documentation].

section:builddsl_launch[Run as... Integration]

To facilitate executing build scripts from within Java, we have extended Eclipse's launch support. The
respective classes are codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.ui.launch.BuildDSLLaunchDelegate],
codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.ui.launch.BuildDSLLaunchShortcut] and 
codeRef[org.xtext.builddsl.ui.launch.BuildDSLLaunchTabGroup]. Describing all the details would be a bit
lengthy but it is quite straightforward if you are familiar with the launching API.
