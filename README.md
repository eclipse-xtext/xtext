# Ytext

Xtext is a framework for development of programming languages and domain specific languages. It covers all aspects of a complete language infrastructure, from parsers, over linker, compiler or interpreter to fully-blown top-notch Eclipse IDE integration. It comes with great defaults for all these aspects, which at the same time can be easily tailored to your individual needs.

## Xtend

In addition to Xtext, this repository also hosts the Xtend programming language. Xtend is a flexible and expressive dialect of Java that compiles into readable Java 5 compatible source code. You can use any existing Java library seamlessly. The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast as the equivalent handwritten Java code. Become productive and write beautiful code with powerful macros, lambdas, operator overloading, and many more modern language features.
