## Java 9 and 10 Support

Xtext and Xtend 2.14 are able to compile with and against Java 10. Here are a few notes on the Support
- There is no native support for Java 9/10 module visibilities but we fall back to jdt/javac on that topic.


## Compiler

### Avoid generation of unnecessary exception variables

When an exception variable is not used within a catch block, the transpiled Java code contained an unused variable. 

Considering the following Xtend snippet:

```
try {
  ... some code ...
} catch (SomeException e) {
  // do nothing with "e"
}
```

The catch block was transpiled to:

```
catch (final Throwable _t) {
  if (_t instanceof SomeException) {
    final SomeException e = (SomeException)_t;
  } else {
    throw Exceptions.sneakyThrow(_t);
  }
}
```

Xtend will now avoid the generation of the variable when it is not used within the catch block:

```
catch (final Throwable _t) {
  if (_t instanceof SomeException) {
  } else {
    throw Exceptions.sneakyThrow(_t);
  }
}
```

### Multi-Catch Support
With Xtend 2.14 the exception handling supports multi-catch clauses.

The multi-catch clause can handle an arbitrary number of exceptions separated by "|". 
Within the catch block, the intersection exception type of the exceptions caught by the multi-catch statement is available for further processing.
Multi-catch support leads to semantically rich and more concise catch statements.


### Multi-Type Guard Support
The type guard feature in switch statements is enhanced by support for testing multiple types in one case statement.

As for the multi-catch statements the different types handled by a single case statement are separated by "|".
The intersection type of the types specified in the multi-type guard statement is available within the case block.

## Unnecessary Modifiers Validation

Xtend detects unnecessary modifiers in code, e.g. the `public` modifier on types. By default issues of this kind are raised as warnings, the severity level is configurable.

For convenient resolution of these issues a quick fix has been added.

## Eclipse Integration

### Organize Imports

The Organize Imports feature has been improved to consider inner types properly.
