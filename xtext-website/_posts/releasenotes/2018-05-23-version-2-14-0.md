## Java 9 and 10 Support

Xtext and Xtend 2.14 are able to compile with and against Java 10. Here are a few notes on the Support
- There is no native support for Java 9/10 module visibilities but we fall back to jdt/javac on that topic.
- You might need a newer Maven version to get support
- You might need a newer Gradle (Wrapper) version. The wizard will create projects accordingly.
- You will need Tycho 1.2.0 and Eclipse Photon as target. (The wizard uses Tycho 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT since the final version is not out yet)
- You will need to upgrade existing projects e.g. with respect to asm if you want to use Java 9/10.

### New Project and File Wizard

With two simple switches you can turn on the generation of a NewProjectWizard and a NewFileWizard for your language.

These wizards are based on flexible templates to generate one or many projects with any number of files. You can enable the generation from your .mwe2 file with two simple switches:

```
language = StandardLanguage {
    name = "org.xtext.example.mydsl.MyDsl"
    fileExtensions = "mydsl"
        
    fileWizard = {
        generate = true
    }
    projectWizard = {
        generate = true
    }
}
```

The wizard to create projects allows to select from a number of templates and creates one or, in certain situations helpful, even many projects.

The wizard to create files is more simple in its basic form and skips the template selection if there is only one file template.

In case there are many templates the wizard gets a second page to configure the parameter whereas on the first page a combo box to select the template appears. 

The UI for the parameters of the templates as well as the templates them self are defined in code with a concise API. You do not need to fiddle around with SWT widgets and get most UI stuff for free. The templates are generated in the UI project of your language. You can adapt the generated templates, add new ones or contribute new template providers through extension points.

If you generate the wizards for an existing project the `plugin.xml` is not regenerated to not risk loosing manual changes you might have applied. Instead a `plugin.xml_gen` is created. You have to merge the generated extensions to your `plugin.xml` manually.
