Xtext 2.27.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Changes to `org.eclipse.xtext.sdk` feature.

The `org.eclipse.xtext.sdk` does no longer package the deprecated `org.eclipse.xtext.generator` bundle. Please migrate to the new workflow/generator. The old and deprecated generator can still be found in the new `org.eclipse.xtext.generator` feature.

## Upgrades
- Tycho 2.7.1
- Xtext now uses Reload4j 1.2.19
- Gradle 7.4.2 / xtext-gradle-plugin 3.0.2
- ASM 9.3

## Changes
- The qualifiers of org.antlr.runtime,javax.xml,org.aopalliance have changed due to (breaking) changes in orbit.

## Enhancements

Xtext makes now use of the [enhanced possibilities](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=579082) for requesting rebuilds in platform. Please test this in your environments and give [feedback](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-eclipse/issues/1820)

## Removals
- Xtext no longer depends on commons lang
