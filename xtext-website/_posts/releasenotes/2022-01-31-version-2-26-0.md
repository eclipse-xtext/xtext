Xtext 2.26.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Upgrades

* Tycho was updated to 2.4.0
* GSON was updated to 2.8.7
* LSP4J was updated to 0.12.0 / protocol version 3.16.0
* Xtext now uses Guice 5.0.1 and thus the warnings on Java 11+ should be gone.
* ASM was updated to 9.2
* Gradle (in Wizard) is now updated to 7.x and the xtext-gradle-plugin to 3.0.0
* Classgraph is updated to 4.8.137

## Bugfixes


## Enhancements

- The Xtext LSP implementation has learned folding support.
- [xtext-maven#139](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-maven/issues/139) : xtext-maven can now install trace information for DSLs with a derived Java model (for example languages using Xbase).

## Deprecations

- The already deprecated MergeableManifest classes we marked "for removal". Make sure you do not longer use them.
- We will drop support for GWT in a future release.
